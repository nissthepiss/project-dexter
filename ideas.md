study our top 10 degen mode runner/mvp current algorithm in our Project Dexter solana token electron app, learn "C:\projects\project dexter\api-analysis.md" to see what api datapoints/frequency we're working with, learn "C:\projects\project dexter\algoreq.md" to see algorithm we're trying to build, improve on it if you will within the boundaries constrains of data/frequency specified in "api-analysis.md"
implement a new algorithm that will efficently, as quickly as possible try to count likelyness of a coin going up, a new mvp scoring system, for top 10 on degen mode (regardless of timeframe). Connect to frontend. Show all score paremeters changing in real time in frontend.
